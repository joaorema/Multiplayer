		<member name="distance" type="float" setter="" getter="get_distance" default="0.0">
			Distance between the origin of the ray and the surface of the cube representing the hit voxel.
		</member>
		<member name="normal" type="Vector3" setter="" getter="get_normal" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			Unit vector pointing away from the surface that was hit.
			This is only available if [VoxelTool] was configured to compute normals. See [method VoxelTool.set_raycast_normal_enabled].
			With blocky voxels, this normal will be based on collision boxes rather than the mesh.
		</member>
		<member name="position" type="Vector3i" setter="" getter="get_position" default="Vector3i(0, 0, 0)">
			Integer position of the voxel that was hit. In a blocky game, this would be the position of the voxel to interact with.
		</member>
		<member name="previous_position" type="Vector3i" setter="" getter="get_previous_position" default="Vector3i(0, 0, 0)">
			Integer position of the previous voxel along the ray before the final hit. In a blocky game, this would be the position of the voxel to place on top of the pointed one.
